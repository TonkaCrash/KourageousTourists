# KourageousTourists

As several threads in KSP forums suggest, tourists sometimes should be able
to go EVA. This very simple mod temporarily promotes tourists to crew during
a flight while imposing a restrictions for EVA depending on tourist level.
Restrictions currently include vessel situation (e.g. LANDED, SPLASHED, 
ORBITING, etc), celestial bodies and surface speed. Sample configuration is
provided in settigns.xml file. After the tourist got recovered, either with
a craft or alone, he/she again becomes a tourist.

(Please expect some bugs, this is very early development)
